# Proyect Gym Rutine

Context

To maximize profits in the gym, a good record is necessary, with this we can evaluate the progress and aim to new goals. People often quits gym because they do not perceive any profit and one of the principal reasons of this issue is the lack of planning and not seeing results. Personally I've been using a text editor to register my progress at gym, nevertheless, it's inefficient to erase and update every single weight or rep everyday, so, It would be helpful to create a program that could show me the objective of the next training and mark if the actual level was completed or not and update depending on that.

To run the program you only need to run the file a.exe. If your operative system can not run this file, you'll need to compile main.cpp with c++ sowftware, make sure all .cpp files are in the same folder.
